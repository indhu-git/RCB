# Royal Challegers Bangalore Team Json Validation

## Project description
This project reads values from JSON file and validate values. I have used jackson library to read the JSON file. I have used java POJO classes to deserialize the JSON values into java objects. I have used testNG frame work to run the tests. Implemented extent reports to view the reslults.
